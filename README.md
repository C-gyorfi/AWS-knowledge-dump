## IAM & AWS CLI
- **IAM** stands for **Identity and Access Management**
- It is a Global service

### Users and groups
- Users (people within the organization)
- Groups -> can contain one or more users(one user can be in multiple group)
- Assigned by policies(JSON format) which gives permissions of the users
- Follows the least privilege principle

### Policies
- Managed policies(created by AWS, e.g IAMReadOnlyAccess-> user can view IAM roles)
- Password Policy - AWS allows setup password policy e.g required chars, allow users to change, expire after a given time or require MFA

### Access
- AWS console
- AWS CLI
- AWS SDK

### More about IAM
- IAM Roles allows AWS services to perform actions
- IAM Credentials Report - report on users and status of their credentials
- IAM Access Advisor - shows the service permissions of a given user and last usage

### Responsibilities
- AWS is responsible for:
> Infrastructure and global network security, configuration/vulnerability analysis and compliance validation

- Organisation/User is responsible for:
>Managing/Monitoring Users, Groups, Roles, Policies, enabling MFA and rotating keys and reviewing permissions

## EC2
Elastic Compute Cloud(infrastructure as a service)
Related services:
- Virtual machines (EC2)
- Virtual drives (EBS)
- Load balancer (ELB)
- Auto-scaling group (ASG)

Storage options:
- network-attached(EBS or EFS)
- hardware (EC2 Instance Store)

Can run a bootstrap script at first boot to setup(EC2 User data script)

### EC2 Instance Types
- General Purpose
- Compute Optimized
- Memory Optimized
- Storage Optimized

### Security Groups
- Security Groups control what is allowed into / out of the instances
- Referenced by IP or by name
- Control access to Ports
- Control authorised IP ranges(IPv4, IPv6)

### Purchasing Options
- On-Demand Instances: no long term commitment, pay per min (or hours on windows)
- Reserved: (min 1 or 3 years)
  - Reserved Instances: long workloads
  - Convertible Reserved Instances: long workloads with flexible instances
  - Scheduled Reserved Instances: specific time
- Spot Instances - can be terminated any time
- Dedicated Hosts - entire physical server
- Dedicated Instances - no hardware share

## EC2 Instance Storage
EC2 Instance Storage are high-performance hardware disk(EBS are network drives with limited performance)
- ephemeral storage(loses data once they got stopped)
- usecases: buffer / cache / scratch data / temp storage

### EBS Volume Types and Use cases
- `General Purpose SSD`: cheap and low latency, good for System boot volumes,Virtual desktops, Dev environments
- `Provisioned IOPS (PIOPS) SSD`: sutained IOPS or applications that need more than 16,000 IOPS, e.g databases workloads (sensitive to storage perf and consistency)
- `Hard Disk Drives (HDD)`: cannot be boot volume, throughput optimized HDD (st1)
good for big data, data Warehouses or cold HDD (sc1) data that is infrequently accessed. 

### EBS Multi-Attach
- Allows attaching EBS to multiple EC2 instances(same AZ)
- Requirement: file system thatâ€™s cluster-aware

### EFS / Elastic File System
- NFS (network file system) that can be mounted on many EC2
- Can be used multi-AZ
- use-cases: content management, web serving, data sharing
- only works with Linux based AMI

## Load Balancing and Auto Scaling
> Vertical Scalability - increasing the size of an instance(hardware limits)

> Horizontal Scalability - increasting the number of instances

> High Availability - runnging the app in multiple data centers(e.g multi AZ)

### Load balancer:
- Distribute load across multiple instances
- Allows using single endpoint (DNS) 
- Does regular health checks on instnces
- Handle failure / Terminates unhealthy instances
- SSL termination (HTTPS)
- Can enforce stickiness (by using cookies to forward request to same instance)

### Types of Load balancer:
- Classic Load Balancer(v1) HTTP, HTTPS, TCP
  - has fixed hostname 
- Application Load Balancer(v2) HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket
  - load balancing multiple application on same machine or accross machines
  - support for HTTP/2 and WebSocket
  - allows routin based on path, hostname or query param
  - great for containerised apps(docker or ECS)
  - fixed hostname
  - client of the IP is in the header `X-Forwarded-For`
- Network Load Balancer(v2) TCP, TLS (secure TCP) & UDP
  - Allows forwarding TCP & UDP traffic
  - Can handle a lot(millions of request per seconds)
  - Low latency (~100 ms vs 400 ms for ALB))
  - Has a single static IP per AZ
  - Supports Elastic IP
  - Not free

### More about load balancing:
- Config LB security group to allow public traffic(in most cases)
- Config application security group to allow traffic from LB
- LB can scale but may take time

### SSL/TLS 
- SSL(Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS(Transport Layer Security)
- allows traffic between clients and load balancer to be encrypted
- can manage certificates with ACM (AWS Certificate Manager) - to upload your own
- LB uses uses an X.509 certificate by default
- Clients can use SNI (Server Name Indication) - allows loading multiple SSL certificates onto one web server - works for ALB & NLB but not for CLB(depreciated)

### Connection Draining
- Connection Draining(CLB) or DeregistrationDelay(for ALB & NLB)
- Time to complete request while instance is deregistering
- Default 300sec can be set 1-3600(depends on avg request completion time)
- set 0 to disable

### Auto Scaling Group
- Matching demand
- Scale out = add instances
- Scale in = remove EC2 instances) 
- Can set minimum and a maximum number of instances
- Can scale an ASG based on CloudWatch alarms(e.g CPU use)
- Free, you pay for the resources you run
- IAM roles attached to an ASG will get assigned to EC2 instances
- Cooldown period to ensure not to launch or terminate additional instances before the previous scaling activity completed

### ASG Scaling Policies
- Target Tracking Scaling (e.g set target CPU usage)
- Step Scaling (e.g CloudWatch alarm is trigger)
- Scheduled Actions (e.g action based on known usage patterns)
